$T$ is nice, but NOT cheap, and for my taste, too far out

$T$ is not the best place to be, esp for u young girls at night to be honest, and not much in the way of shopping either

My friend was saying $T$ is good , but the commute to Central London is very painful
location1
2
green-nature
NW of $T$ is $T$, and that's pretty nice
location1
2
green-nature
Near to $T$ are nicer areas within the London boroughs of Bexley and bromley
location1
2
green-nature
Old $T$ around the outlet to the tunnel is pretty grotty
location1
2
green-nature
On the other hand i personally live in $T$ , very nice area, and i personally feel that it's allot better than LOCATION2
location1
2
green-nature
Or try $T$ where you can get more for your money
location1
2
green-nature
Out of the two I'd prefer $T$ to $T$
location1
2
green-nature
Out of these i would say, $T$ (upper)

Personally, having lived there, I would say $T$ was a little more 'upmarket' but watch out for the planes - a lot of houses in $T$ are on the landing flightpath into heathrow which can be very irritating at around 4.30/5.00 in the morning, especially in summer

2
green-nature
The main one to avoid is $T$
location1
2
green-nature
The reputation as London 's red light district is old-fashioned and no longer deserved , and $T$ is very cosmopolitian and trendy with a high gay population
