Although $T$ is picturesque with its park and  it does have quite a high crime rate and because it is close to the centre of London it is rarther expensive
location1
2
multicultural
But you get the best of both worlds with leafy $T$ 10 mins walk in one direction and non-stop $T$ in the other were ever u can find a place with your budget
location1
2
multicultural
Check out the parks like $T$ because they can be nice too
location1

multicultural
Dependent on where you are but there are two options to me:- $T$ (LOCATION2) A lovely green area with a great view of London
location1
2
multicultural
Enjoy $T$ is free nice park lots goin on
location1
2
multicultural
Here you are : $T$ has a sizeable shopping area with a Vue cinema , the regular department/chain stores and a stack of bars and restaurants , and also lots of green space around for enjoying the kind of weather we 're having today
location1

multicultural
However, $T$ is safe and peaceful, and the nearby osterley Park is attractive

I like leafy $T$
location1
2
multicultural
I live in $T$ where it is leafy and the streets around me are nice but 10 minutes walk away there is a huge estate full of drug dealers
location1
2
multicultural
I live on the edge of $T$, so have great access to green spaces, outdoor swimming, local/independent shops and cafes, plus a generally nice, safe neighbourhood
location1
2
multicultural
I looked at all the options and opted for $T$ in Kent in the end - mainly because it's very green and rural, but it's also one of the last stops for the fast coast trains before the get to London
location1
2
multicultural
I loved the village and thought $T$ was just beautiful , especially the lake , and it only took about 30 minutes to get to LOCATION2 Rd
location1
2
multicultural
I think that great care has been taken in $T$ to preserve parks and green areas
location1
2
multicultural
I think this is influenced by big swathes of northwest $T$ (covered by SM1) being endless utilitarian residential streets with precious few green spaces nor natural features to enhance the landscape
location1
2
multicultural
In West London the areas of $T$ and LOCATION1 are very nicelots of green space, nice housing, good transportation links, but it's expensive

Only part of south-east I would recommend is $T$ but it's ridiculously expensive being in Central

Perhamps if you increased you budget a touch you could think about looking at renting in $T$, its a nice place just out of town, yet close enough to make it feasable if you work in town

Avoid $T$ at all costs

Avoid $T$ because it's dirtier and more dangerous, and be aware that there is a lot of council housing in the area

Avoid $T$ unless you are totally hardcore

Basically yes there are places to that are leafy and fairly quiet but no where will ever be as quiet as outside London $T$ is okay
location1
2
multicultural
Because the $T$ area was built so fast you will find it lacks character as buildings and houses were built so fast and the majority were made to the same specification

Better areas include LOCATION1 and $T$ for instance

But I think $T$ is a good bet

But I wouldn't choose $T$

But all across $T$ there are very nice suburbs , too many to mention

If you want somewhere more funkier and trendier - what about $T$
location1

multicultural
In LOCATION2 $T$ has some nice streets
location1
2
multicultural
In contrast, $T$ is lovely - leafy, EXTREMELY highly sought after - house prices through the roof
location1
2
multicultural
In general , $T$ is a good choice , do some more research and you might be able to find a good house share or a 1 bed flat too for a decent rental price

Inner suburbs like LOCATION1 and $T$ are also worth considering especially if you plan to go out at night and want a taxi ride home that wo n't cost a fortune

Is it because $T$ is a ` poor and more multicultural area '
location1
2
multicultural
It 's a very nice locale , pretty much matches the description of what you are looking for , and you can probably find a place round there that is suitably expensive $T$ is okay
location1
2
multicultural
It 's actually quite good $T$ is a very very desirable area - amazing that you can afford to live there as a student
location1
2
multicultural
It 's true there are more ` upmarket ' areas of London , but for me the $T$ has the right mix of the rough and the smooth
location1
2
multicultural
It also depends on how far you need to travel for work , not that that 's much of an issue in London $T$ is undoubtedly the nicest area , but im prob a bit biased
location1
2
multicultural
It is OK To be honest, $T$ has got a lot better than it used to be - really cleaned up it's act

I used to live in $T$ which also has a bad reputation but I never had any trouble despite coming home alone very late at night (1-2am)
location1
2
green-nature
I would feel less safe walking around $T$ at night than I do elsewhere in LB of LOCATION2, relatively-speaking
location1

green-nature
I would n't say $T$ is dangerous exactly but it definitely has higher crime rates than many other areas
location1
2
green-nature
I would not feel safe walking at night in $T$

green-nature
I'd recommend $T$ in particular, which is near $T$ and feels very safe

I'm living in $T$ at the moment and am extremely unhappy ,  the area is a bit scary at night and need to move asap

I'm mounique I'm 14 and live in $T$ in London, It is a deprived area and high in crime, there is massive gangs around who cause trouble

I've spent a lot of time in $T$ and can confirm it's generally quite a deprived area and certainly not that safe after dark

If you 're a young male drug-dealer who takes part in the occasional heist , then yes , $T$ could be dangerous for you
location1
2
green-nature
If you scoot across a little way to LOCATION1 it's nice but $T$ itself is pretty rough

In fact I've never once even seen a fight on the streets in $T$ and I go out all the time during the week

In fact the only people I know who have been mugged have been two people living in $T$, one of the most expensive areas of London, and LOCATION2, another ridiculously expensive area

In my first year I lived in LOCATION2/$T$ - it is definitely a safe and central area and relatively affordable

Just living in $T$ does not mean you will automatically become a victim of crime

Just looking briefly, it shows me that the closer to the centre, the more dangerous the area, with $T$ having the most crime

$T$ is an inner London area with a multi-cultural population and quite high unemployment and poverty rates ; in other words , it 's by no means an upmarket part of town It 's as safe as anywhere else , probably safer than some of the ` ghetto ' type areas of London ( and other cities )

i will recommend the $T$ area because there  is low crime as far as i know and the houses are pretty reasonable maybe a bit expensive but it is worth it and there is good access to London by car (i think) and definitely good access by public transport

places such as $T$, which is south London are up and coming areas, that have quite a few council homes and nice area, it is very close to the London centre, only a few tube stops

the big advantage of $T$ is the transport links   at Finsbury Park Station you've got two tube lines and mainline rail lines and can get to just about anywhere in London easily

the least environmental impact is to expand $T$ as it's an established hub with proper transport links

you should maybe try $T$ for convenience of travel and because of 2012 olympics

'' Similarly neither has the jubilee line which means the odd time you end up going half way round the world just to go two stops , making the $T$ seem a bit cut off at times

I sure as hell wouldn't wanna be stuck in a shithole like bloody $T$

I think $T$ gets a raw deal because it's close to some dodgy areas like LOCATION1,  but actually it's alright, a bit of a hidden gem in fact
location2

green-nature
I would really recommend $T$
location1
2
green-nature
I would say $T$ but it may exceed your budget by a little but it is worth the move
location1
2
green-nature
I would say with the massive increase in supply around the area, and the amount of security they have $T$ is your best bet  Don't waste your money
location1
2

I would stay away from LOCATION1 and $T$ area's as many parts are very run down and deprived

I would strongly recommend flats in the $T$ as this area is growing quickly and many of the flats are newly built meaning the design will be quite modern as well

I've never been to $T$ - due to its reputation, mostly

green-nature
I've spent a lot of time in $T$ and can confirm it's generally quite a deprived area and certainly not that safe after dark

Lots of bars and restaurants in $T$ You could go dog racing also, that is local and lots of fun I'd say that it's a nice area and not a particularly dangerous area to live,  I'd be wary of is just around  the LOCATION1 Lane Estate

Also  $T$ which is  slightly more mixed demographic compared to the more affluent LOCATION1 but certainly up and coming, it has good amenities (on the Jubilee line which is very efficient and a Sainsburys)

Also , nearby $T$ is also great , they have a microbrewery that brews and sells its own beer on site

Also $T$ i like so much, but it's a bit more expensive

Basically yes there are places to that are leafy and fairly quiet but no where will ever be as quiet as outside London $T$ is okay
location1
2
green-nature
Because the $T$ area was built so fast you will find it lacks character as buildings and houses were built so fast and the majority were made to the same specification

2
green-nature
Better areas include LOCATION1 and $T$ for instance

Bottom line, if you are either looking for a house to live in or as an investment, I recommend $T$, BIG TIME

But I reckon $T$ is the way to go
location1
2
green-nature
But I think $T$ is a good bet

But I wouldn't choose $T$

2
green-nature
But all across $T$ there are very nice suburbs , too many to mention

But aside from this image you'll find $T$ to be on balance a prosperous and youthful town

But yes , for further into London , $T$ is a great area

By London Standards $T$ is a cheap area , mostly because it 's a pretty run down area

I've heard from a few ex work mates the council areas in $T$ are not very nice but it's not personal experience though

2
green-nature
I've spent a lot of time in $T$ and can confirm it's generally quite a deprived area and certainly not that safe after dark

Id love to live in the $T$ area, it looks so nice and clean and transport is great in there

If anyone offered me a place on The $T$ I'd jump at it

If i had to choose between the two i would definitely go for $T$ though

green-nature
If you must live in London I would suggest $T$ - it has far more life and
location1
2
green-nature
If you need to commute to London on a daily basis then $T$ is at the end of the District Line and is a decent area
location1
2
green-nature
If you scoot across a little way to $T$ it's nice but LOCATION2 itself is pretty rough

In LOCATION2 $T$ has some nice streets

In contrast, $T$ is lovely - leafy, EXTREMELY highly sought after - house prices through the roof
location1

green-nature
In general , $T$ is a good choice , do some more research and you might be able to find a good house share or a 1 bed flat too for a decent rental price

Inner suburbs like LOCATION1 and $T$ are also worth considering especially if you plan to go out at night and want a taxi ride home that wo n't cost a fortune

Is it because $T$ is a ` poor and more multicultural area '

It 's a very nice locale , pretty much matches the description of what you are looking for , and you can probably find a place round there that is suitably expensive $T$ is okay

It 's actually quite good $T$ is a very very desirable area - amazing that you can afford to live there as a student
location1
2
green-nature
It 's true there are more ` upmarket ' areas of London , but for me the $T$ has the right mix of the rough and the smooth
location1
2
green-nature
It also depends on how far you need to travel for work , not that that 's much of an issue in London $T$ is undoubtedly the nicest area , but im prob a bit biased

It is OK To be honest, $T$ has got a lot better than it used to be - really cleaned up it's act

Although $T$ is picturesque with its park and  it does have quite a high crime rate and because it is close to the centre of London it is rarther expensive

Try $T$  (cheap accomopdation+food)  Avoid LOCATION2 (not safe for night travels)

touristy
i would say most parts of $T$ are total safe for anyone at any time

I lived in $T$ for four years, and the worst thing about it  was that the public transport sucks
location1

touristy
I looked at all the options and opted for $T$ in Kent in the end - mainly because it's very green and rural, but it's also one of the last stops for the fast coast trains before the get to London

North and west of the centre are the places to look , and $T$ has more tube lines going through it than any other station
location1

touristy
On the whole $T$ is a better bet than South London and the tube or the overground or buses will get you around very easily because public transport links are very good
location1

Only part of south-east I would recommend is $T$ but it's ridiculously expensive being in Central

Perhamps if you increased you budget a touch you could think about looking at renting in $T$, its a nice place just out of town, yet close enough to make it feasable if you work in town
location1

Perhaps try $T$, pretty cheap, fair few parks, Has the hammersmith and London line and District

The $T$ is well served by the buses - and it's great to travel into central London on the Thames Clipper boat service from time to time

The central line goes to $T$ where the Olympic site has been developed with excellent shopping
location1
2

Basically yes there are places to that are leafy and fairly quiet but no where will ever be as quiet as outside London $T$ is okay
location1
2
touristy
Because the $T$ area was built so fast you will find it lacks character as buildings and houses were built so fast and the majority were made to the same specification

Better areas include LOCATION1 and $T$ for instance

Bottom line, if you are either looking for a house to live in or as an investment, I recommend $T$, BIG TIME

But I wouldn't choose $T$
location1

But $T$ is one big dump I do n't know where you got that information from , but it 's not true
location1

touristy
But all across $T$ there are very nice suburbs , too many to mention
location1
2

But aside from this image you'll find $T$ to be on balance a prosperous and youthful town

I think $T$'s not that bad an area   it's probably less rough than $T$
location1

touristy
I think LOCATION1/$T$ is a great area
location2
2
touristy
I think $T$/LOCATION2 is a great area
location1
2

I think $T$ is better but then I'm prejudiced LOCATION1 is one of the most expensive areas in London
location2

I think LOCATION2's an ok place too  $T$ is nicest of those areas

touristy
I think the $T$/LOCATION1 area would be absolutely perfect for you
location2
2
touristy
I think this is influenced by big swathes of northwest $T$ (covered by SM1) being endless utilitarian residential streets with precious few green spaces nor natural features to enhance the landscape
location1

I used to live in $T$ and I liked it

location1
2
touristy
I would look at $T$
location1
2
touristy
I would n't want to live in either , but $T$ has some nice houses being build along the canal and the Olympics will force the council to improve matters further
location1
2
touristy
I would pick $T$
location1
2
touristy
I would prob have to say that $T$ is nicer - LOCATION2 is too boxy
location1
2
touristy
I would put in a good word for $T$ though
location1
2
touristy
I would recommend LOCATION2 or $T$
location1
2
touristy
I would recommend $T$ or LOCATION1
location2
2
touristy
I would recommend a suburb called $T$, as it has a Thames link Line and a large underground station making transport very convenient

I would recommend either $T$ or LOCATION2 as an alternative

location1
2

I''ve been only in the west part and I read that LOCATION2/$T$ is becoming popular and trendy among youths, isn't it

touristy
I'd avoid nearby $T$ though
location1
2
touristy
I'd certainly prefer $T$ to $T$
location1
2
touristy
I'd recommend $T$ - you should be able to get, a least, a reasonably sized studio, or one-bedroom flat for that price around there
location1
2
touristy
I'd recommend $T$ in particular, which is near $T$ and feels very safe
location1
2

I'm a fan of $T$ though
location1
2
touristy
I'm living in $T$ at the moment and am extremely unhappy ,  the area is a bit scary at night and need to move asap
location1
2
touristy
I'm mounique I'm 14 and live in $T$ in London, It is a deprived area and high in crime, there is massive gangs around who cause trouble

I've always loved the area around $T$
location1
2
touristy
I've had some recommendations that I stay along bayswater Road around the $T$ Station as it is "nicer" and "safer"
location1
2
touristy
I've heard from a few ex work mates the council areas in $T$ are not very nice but it's not personal experience though
location1
2
touristy
I've spent a lot of time in $T$ and can confirm it's generally quite a deprived area and certainly not that safe after dark
location1
2
touristy
Id love to live in the $T$ area, it looks so nice and clean and transport is great in there
location1
2
touristy
If I were personally buying a property in London, I would probably go for $T$ as it is a great area, always in demand
location1
2
touristy
If anyone offered me a place on The $T$ I'd jump at it
location1
2
touristy
If i had to choose between the two i would definitely go for $T$ though
location1
2
touristy
If it is n't too expensive $T$ would be a good bet as well
location1
2
touristy
If you are at the end adjoining LOCATION2 and $T$, you should be all right
location1

If you are not planning on going out that much in the evenings $T$ would be ok
location1
2

If you are thinking north, then perhaps look at $T$
location1
2
touristy
If you can afford more, then move somewhere better (LOCATION1 or $T$)

location1
2
touristy
If you have loads of money , $T$ is beautiful but expensive It depends what your budget is , $T$ one of the poshest
location1
2
touristy
If you must live in London I would suggest $T$ - it has far more life and
location1
2
touristy
If you need to commute to London on a daily basis then $T$ is at the end of the District Line and is a decent area
location1
2
touristy
If you scoot across a little way to $T$ it's nice but LOCATION2 itself is pretty rough
location1
2
touristy
If you want a bit better quality of life  consider $T$ and LOCATION2  being the nicest in my opinion
location1

touristy
If you want slightly nicer  look at homes in $T$
location1
2
touristy
If you want somewhere more funkier and trendier - what about $T$
location1
2
touristy
In LOCATION2 $T$ has some nice streets
location1
2
touristy
In contrast, $T$ is lovely - leafy, EXTREMELY highly sought after - house prices through the roof
location1
2
touristy
In general , $T$ is a good choice , do some more research and you might be able to find a good house share or a 1 bed flat too for a decent rental price
location1
2
touristy
Inner suburbs like LOCATION1 and $T$ are also worth considering especially if you plan to go out at night and want a taxi ride home that wo n't cost a fortune
location2

touristy
Inner suburbs like $T$ and LOCATION2 are also worth considering especially if you plan to go out at night and want a taxi ride home that wo n't cost a fortune
location1
2
touristy
Is it because $T$ is a ` poor and more multicultural area '
location1
2
touristy
It 's a very nice locale , pretty much matches the description of what you are looking for , and you can probably find a place round there that is suitably expensive $T$ is okay
location1
2
touristy
It 's actually quite good $T$ is a very very desirable area - amazing that you can afford to live there as a student
location1
2
touristy
It 's true there are more ` upmarket ' areas of London , but for me the $T$ has the right mix of the rough and the smooth
location1
2
touristy
It also depends on how far you need to travel for work , not that that 's much of an issue in London $T$ is undoubtedly the nicest area , but im prob a bit biased
location1
2
touristy
It is OK To be honest, $T$ has got a lot better than it used to be - really cleaned up it's act
location1
2

Just stay away from LOCATION1/$T$ Lane

2
touristy
$T$ has a very large student population because of the university so you will see a lot more of them than the dodgy people
location1

$T$ has become a fashionable area, especially around the Columbia Road
location1
2
touristy
$T$ has become more fashionable recently and is probably the cheapest area to live in
location1
2
touristy
$T$ has been gentrified for over 40+ years,using London incomes to push property prices even higher than the national average,because of it's proximity to central London

$T$ is a pleasant and safe area
location1
2
touristy
$T$ is a pleasant enough suburb , but very quite and a fair distance to any large shopping area
location1
2
touristy
$T$ is a pretty decent area and links to LOCATION2 are excellent
location1
2
touristy
$T$ is a pretty nice area

location1
2
touristy
$T$ is an inner London area with a multi-cultural population and quite high unemployment and poverty rates ; in other words , it 's by no means an upmarket part of town It 's as safe as anywhere else , probably safer than some of the ` ghetto ' type areas of London ( and other cities )
location1
2
touristy
$T$ is an unfashionable postcode area , but the town is a nice place to live and the extensive suburbs provide much scope to find slightly affordable living space

2
touristy
$T$ wasn't such a nice area but  it didn't take long to get into  LOCATION2
location1
2
touristy
$T$ which covers a number of areas close to LOCATION2 has seen (in my mind) a huge social decline
location1
2
touristy
$T$ will be ok , but like I said , ANY part of ANY London can be a danger
location1
2
touristy
$T$ would be a good choice , but the rent is quite expensive

touristy
$T$ would be okay

Opinions and assistance is greatly appreciated , many thanks I 'm sure your friends will keep you safe , just listen to what they say like any urban area you need to be streetwise maybe East and $T$ are not the best areas but they 're a long way from the worst areas too being caucasian is not a big deal , there 's still lots of white British people living there even though there 's a large Asian population too the couple of times I 've been over there it always struck me as very vibrant I went into a few of the Asian shops and they were always very welcoming

Other than that $T$ is pretty bad , the housings grim and theres a high crime rate A lot depends upon what you mean by worst area

location1

Perhamps if you increased you budget a touch you could think about looking at renting in $T$, its a nice place just out of town, yet close enough to make it feasable if you work in town
location1
2
touristy
Perhaps try $T$, pretty cheap, fair few parks, Has the hammersmith and London line and District
location1
2
touristy
Personally , I prefer LOCATION2 , it has a busy cosmopolitan feel whereas $T$ has an unfinished quality

Price wise , it is quite expensive though $T$ is very nice , there are some very nice period houses , most quite large
location1
2
touristy
Right now I am pretty satisfied with the Beaufort Park at $T$, but some ppl says LOCATION1 is a horribly unsafe neighbourhood
location2
2
touristy
Sadly I no longer live in London but I'd probably look at $T$ if I was going back
location1
2
touristy
Safe, clean, modern  $T$ :)
location1
2
touristy
Seriously  Personally, i don't like $T$
location1

So, please don't think we are being ignorant,   Try $T$
location1

touristy
Some areas, such as $T$, are dearer than others London is such a big place and has so much to see
location1

Some parts of $T$ are very nice and fashionable but therefore pricey

The $T$ (central London) is always kept spotless, and street cleaners seems to be out 24/7

The LOCATION1 is massively varied and goes between areas you would not enter at night to other areas where houses coost a Million I advise you to get a rental agent It is not a good area,$T$ in general can be quite rough
location2

touristy
The $T$ is very nice these days a probably the most desirable place in London

The best thing about $T$ is that it has a tube station which makes it much more desirable
location1
2
touristy
The best thing about $T$ is that it's hip (ish) and there's lots to do but still very, very easy to get to and out of

The good bits  near the $T$ (N1) are very nice, very central and also safe

The north side of $T$ has characteristically `` inner London '' deprivation
location1
2
touristy
The other choice is $T$ village because it's also in south London and a really clean, quaint area with a lovely gallery
location1
2
touristy
The rents have sky rocketed after the Olympics and although it has seen some improvement over the years , $T$ is still a dump for homelessness , beggars , anti-social behaviour and pick pockets
location1
2
touristy
The stereotype is an old one of $T$, the area is very trendy now
location1
2
touristy
The streets are brightly painted in impressive graffiti, $T$ is a really interesting place and the clubs/bars are very cool
location1
2
touristy
The town we were in was called $T$ - it was reasonable and very nice
location1
2
touristy
The whole $T$ area has been rocketing upmarket ever since the new British Library moved there
location1

Then again your perception of how nice an area is depends on where you're moving from  I love $T$ and always feel safe there ; it's one of my favourite areas
location1
2
touristy
Then finally I moved to $T$ in LOCATION2 which was cheap but I personally didnt like it there

location1
2
touristy
There are some nice areas around $T$ near Brunel University
location1
2
touristy
There are some poor-looking housing estates near $T$ station, although you'd expect such places
location1
2
touristy
There are worse places to live, and $T$'s relatively cheap
location1
2
touristy
There is $T$ village I lived there for a few years and its very nice, expensive but very cheerful
location1
2
touristy
There is a tube station right across from the $T$ which is on a main street of shops, restaurants, hotels, etc  It is a very central part of London, and very nice

When I was there, I spent time in both the West and East ends of London, and I definitely preferred $T$
location1
2

Not sure about the areas in $T$, but $T$ is nice, albeit expensive
location1

One of the cheapest places in south east is $T$, but it's a bit rough round the edges
location1
2
quiet
Only part of south-east I would recommend is $T$ but it's ridiculously expensive being in Central
location1
2
quiet
Only problem is it's quite expensive - otherwise I'd be living in $T$ right now
location1
2
quiet
Or $T$ - cheap

Other people have mentioned $T$, but this borough is pretty expensive, especially LOCATION1

location1
2

Otherwise maybe $T$ - really nice, but maybe out of your budget
location1
2
quiet
Particularly there are many more nice places in $T$ to rent, so competition has driven down prices
location1
2
quiet
Parts of $T$ ain't bad- (although parts of it are quite expensive
location1
2
quiet
Parts of $T$ are village like but they are very expensive
location1
2
quiet
Parts of LOCATION2 are expensive like $T$ but there are still lots on offer
location1
2
quiet
Perhamps if you increased you budget a touch you could think about looking at renting in $T$, its a nice place just out of town, yet close enough to make it feasable if you work in town
location1
2
quiet
Perhaps try $T$, pretty cheap, fair few parks, Has the hammersmith and London line and District
location1
2
quiet
Plus , there are loads of good , cheap restaurants there , and $T$ has good shopping amenties and two cinemas

The $T$ is massively varied and goes between areas you would not enter at night to other areas where houses coost a Million I advise you to get a rental agent It is not a good area,LOCATION2 in general can be quite rough

The absolute cheapest part of London to live in is the $T$ area

The average house price in $T$ is going to be MUCH higher than the average price in $T$

The cheapest place to live in London will be in mid London (such as LOCATION1, $T$) but these places will not necessarily have the best crime rates, houses, or open spaces

The down side is that the northern line is n't the most reliable of transport links and $T$ can be very expsensive

The more affluent areas such as LOCATION1 and $T$ would mean you spending around a million on a house or large flat

The only time I was attacked by humans was 40 years ago in $T$ which is one of the most affluent areas of London
location1
2
quiet
The rents have sky rocketed after the Olympics and although it has seen some improvement over the years , $T$ is still a dump for homelessness , beggars , anti-social behaviour and pick pockets
location1
2
quiet
The rich folk live mainly in $T$, but these same people, mostly of the aristocratic kind, also have country houses and will probably only be in town (London) during the 'season'
location1

The very centre of London (places like $T$) are very well off and there are lower levels of crime

Then finally I moved to $T$ in LOCATION2 which was cheap but I personally didnt like it there
location1
2
quiet
There are worse places to live, and $T$'s relatively cheap
location1
2
quiet
There is $T$ village I lived there for a few years and its very nice, expensive but very cheerful
location1
2
quiet
There is just a different feel to $T$, they have some great places to eat, shop, historical sites to visit, plus the Heath,   its a very affluent area of London and most people would consider it a desirable place to live
location1
2
quiet
They are expensive areas, as is $T$
location1
2
quiet
They are often very wealthy and well connected , many of them are from overseas , and they socialise in circles where they have known each other for many years through their families , public school or work etc and they are wary of outsiders $T$ is a pretty wealthy area so it is generally quite safe but it is still part of London
location1
2
quiet
Try $T$  (cheap accomopdation+food)  Avoid LOCATION2 (not safe for night travels)
location1
2
quiet
Try some parts of LOCATION2 aswell $T$ is still good as the prices there are not as high as elsewhere and the transport is fairly good from there
location1
2

Try this link:  They have quite cheap studio flats in LOCATION1 and $T$, all pretty safe and nice from what I've heard

Well $T$ is very expensive
location1
2
quiet
Well yes, if you can afford to live in $T$ then it would be great but very very expensive
location1
2
quiet
When the $T$ was being re-developed , old wharves and warehouses were transformed into luxury apartments priced at 1million and such like
location1
2
quiet
Whereas $T$ has cheap housing ( in comparrison with the rest of the London ) and lots of bars/clubs but the area is pretty bland
location1
2
quiet
Yes, $T$ - but its VERY expensive
location1
2
quiet
You 're probably going to have to pay in excess of 900 a month for a studio flat to live in that sort of location ( $T$ is a 45 minute commute outside of the London , hence why it is cheaper )

You can find cheaper areas in LOCATION1 or  $T$, but may not be nice for your wife and baby

On the whole $T$ is a better bet than South London and the tube or the overground or buses will get you around very easily because public transport links are very good
location1
2
quiet
Only part of south-east I would recommend is $T$ but it's ridiculously expensive being in Central

Perhamps if you increased you budget a touch you could think about looking at renting in $T$, its a nice place just out of town, yet close enough to make it feasable if you work in town
location1

Perhaps try $T$, pretty cheap, fair few parks, Has the hammersmith and London line and District

The central line goes to $T$ where the Olympic site has been developed with excellent shopping
location1
2

The good bits  near the $T$ (N1) are very nice, very central and also safe

I would say $T$ but it may exceed your budget by a little but it is worth the move

Basically yes there are places to that are leafy and fairly quiet but no where will ever be as quiet as outside London $T$ is okay
location1
2

Because the $T$ area was built so fast you will find it lacks character as buildings and houses were built so fast and the majority were made to the same specification

If anyone offered me a place on The $T$ I'd jump at it

If i had to choose between the two i would definitely go for $T$ though

If you must live in London I would suggest $T$ - it has far more life and
location1
2
quiet
If you need to commute to London on a daily basis then $T$ is at the end of the District Line and is a decent area

In LOCATION2 $T$ has some nice streets

In contrast, $T$ is lovely - leafy, EXTREMELY highly sought after - house prices through the roof

In general , $T$ is a good choice , do some more research and you might be able to find a good house share or a 1 bed flat too for a decent rental price

Is it because $T$ is a ` poor and more multicultural area '
location1
2

It 's a very nice locale , pretty much matches the description of what you are looking for , and you can probably find a place round there that is suitably expensive $T$ is okay
location1

It 's actually quite good $T$ is a very very desirable area - amazing that you can afford to live there as a student
location1
2
quiet
It 's true there are more ` upmarket ' areas of London , but for me the $T$ has the right mix of the rough and the smooth
location1
2
quiet
It also depends on how far you need to travel for work , not that that 's much of an issue in London $T$ is undoubtedly the nicest area , but im prob a bit biased

It is OK To be honest, $T$ has got a lot better than it used to be - really cleaned up it's act

Opinions and assistance is greatly appreciated , many thanks I 'm sure your friends will keep you safe , just listen to what they say like any urban area you need to be streetwise maybe East and $T$ are not the best areas but they 're a long way from the worst areas too being caucasian is not a big deal , there 's still lots of white British people living there even though there 's a large Asian population too the couple of times I 've been over there it always struck me as very vibrant I went into a few of the Asian shops and they were always very welcoming
