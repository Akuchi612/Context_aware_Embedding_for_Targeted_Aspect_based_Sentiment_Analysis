I lived in the heart of $T$ and never felt safer - it just looked ugly

I only know about LOCATION1, most people prefer $T$, but that's because they are trendy and I'm not

I went to $T$ honest to god, I didn't like the area at all
location1
2

I would therefore pick $T$ because its quite a nice area

I'd reommend you go $T$, rather than LOCATION2, because there are so few tube stations in LOCATION2 London

$T$ is a lovely town with plenty of restaurants , you wo n't go hungry that 's for sure and if you wanted to pop up into London for an evening there 's trains every 15 minutes or so

$T$ is amazing but you need literally millions to live there aha

$T$ is beautiful and you will be highly privileged to live there You 'll be fine LOCATION2 has more restaurants and cafes and has more of an `` urban town '' feel but the three are very close

$T$ is ok , but can be a bit grotty , and getting on to the M1 can be a pain , LOCATION2 , would be more beneficial , as you have the Jubilee line into London , and your only minutes away from Junction 4 of the M1 , to get to Luton

$T$ is quite a cool place to wander about with a couple of markets , a big park , and the river thames to walk along London Eye

$T$ is rough and quite nasty - I would not like to walk round there at night

$T$ which is a bit of a dump, doesn't reflect LOCATION2 at all

$T$,  is not exactly the most "up-market " part of town by any means

Another good place to consider is $T$ as there are many shops and a few clubs, and it is situated on the central line so only a few stops from central London and hotspots such as Oxford Street

Another place to consider is $T$ - it's got some lovely areas, it's on the river, there are some great independent shops, there are good restaurants and cafes and a great market

Thanks a lot $T$ is very good , quite arty and a lot of actors/musicians live there but stay away from the Newington Green area if you can help it and watch out for the Maybury and other estates after dark I should think you 'll get somewhere to rent on that sort of income as you have a good job

You're very lucky - $T$ is generally a lovely part of London, and very central

Your best bet is to look south of the river- possibly $T$, which is where my other half comes from
location1
2

anywhere apart from $T$ lol

but i would say now-days that $T$ is not too bad  I wouldn't move there because local prices will rocket when they finally get round to finishing the Olympic village

but you could always sign a short let and see how things go just stay out of $T$

Yes $T$ is nice ( some of it ) , although the tourist bit is rather expensive

have a look round the 'poets corner' part of $T$ (few nice bars, getting quite trendy), you would get a bit more for your money

lots of nightlife in The $T$ area, it really buzzes in the evenings   rental accommodation is quite pricey around that area    but I personally would find it a bit claustrophobic to live in

I went to $T$ honest to god, I didn't like the area at all

I would therefore pick $T$ because its quite a nice area

I'd reommend you go $T$, rather than LOCATION2, because there are so few tube stations in LOCATION2 London

$T$ is a lovely town with plenty of restaurants , you wo n't go hungry that 's for sure and if you wanted to pop up into London for an evening there 's trains every 15 minutes or so

$T$ is ok , but can be a bit grotty , and getting on to the M1 can be a pain , LOCATION2 , would be more beneficial , as you have the Jubilee line into London , and your only minutes away from Junction 4 of the M1 , to get to Luton

$T$ is quite a cool place to wander about with a couple of markets , a big park , and the river thames to walk along London Eye

$T$ is rough and quite nasty - I would not like to walk round there at night

$T$ which is a bit of a dump, doesn't reflect LOCATION2 at all

$T$,  is not exactly the most "up-market " part of town by any means

I would suggest $T$ its only 15 minutes away on the train and the north circular is only 15 minute drive down

I lived in the heart of $T$ and never felt safer - it just looked ugly
location1
2

I only know about LOCATION1, most people prefer $T$, but that's because they are trendy and I'm not

2

I went to $T$ honest to god, I didn't like the area at all
location1
2
dining
I would therefore pick $T$ because its quite a nice area
location1
2

I'd reommend you go $T$, rather than LOCATION2, because there are so few tube stations in LOCATION2 London

I'm not from LOCATION2 but the borough but my sister lives in $T$ and she loves it

LOCATION1 is a good location (depending on exactly where though to be honest I meant $T$ end isn't exactly glamorous
location2
2

$T$ is a lovely town with plenty of restaurants , you wo n't go hungry that 's for sure and if you wanted to pop up into London for an evening there 's trains every 15 minutes or so

$T$ is a nice, safe area, lots of lovely families there

$T$ is ok , but can be a bit grotty , and getting on to the M1 can be a pain , LOCATION2 , would be more beneficial , as you have the Jubilee line into London , and your only minutes away from Junction 4 of the M1 , to get to Luton
location1
2

$T$ is quite a cool place to wander about with a couple of markets , a big park , and the river thames to walk along London Eye
location1

$T$ is rough and quite nasty - I would not like to walk round there at night
location1
2

$T$ which is a bit of a dump, doesn't reflect LOCATION2 at all

$T$,  is not exactly the most "up-market " part of town by any means

$T$,  tend towards being less cool, more touristy

Another good place to consider is $T$ as there are many shops and a few clubs, and it is situated on the central line so only a few stops from central London and hotspots such as Oxford Street

I have been based in a apartment by $T$ for a few months no trouble convenient location
location1
2
nightlife
I lived in the heart of $T$ and never felt safer - it just looked ugly
location1
2
nightlife
I only know about LOCATION1, most people prefer $T$, but that's because they are trendy and I'm not
location2
2
nightlife
I went to $T$ honest to god, I didn't like the area at all
location1
2
nightlife
I would therefore pick $T$ because its quite a nice area
location1
2
nightlife
I'd reommend you go $T$, rather than LOCATION2, because there are so few tube stations in LOCATION2 London
location1
2
nightlife
I'm not from LOCATION2 but the borough but my sister lives in $T$ and she loves it

LOCATION1 has lots of good restaurants etc , and $T$  is very nice
location2
2
nightlife
LOCATION1 is a good location (depending on exactly where though to be honest I meant $T$ end isn't exactly glamorous
location2
2
nightlife
$T$ is a lovely town with plenty of restaurants , you wo n't go hungry that 's for sure and if you wanted to pop up into London for an evening there 's trains every 15 minutes or so
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is a nice, safe area, lots of lovely families there

2
nightlife
LOCATION1 is a particularly nice area to live in , $T$ is also extremly nice

$T$ is alright ,  not one of the worst areas
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is amazing but you need literally millions to live there aha
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is beautiful and you will be highly privileged to live there You 'll be fine LOCATION2 has more restaurants and cafes and has more of an `` urban town '' feel but the three are very close

$T$ is having lots of money thrown at it right now

2
nightlife
$T$ is not to bad
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is ok , but can be a bit grotty , and getting on to the M1 can be a pain , LOCATION2 , would be more beneficial , as you have the Jubilee line into London , and your only minutes away from Junction 4 of the M1 , to get to Luton
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is quite a cool place to wander about with a couple of markets , a big park , and the river thames to walk along London Eye
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ is rough and quite nasty - I would not like to walk round there at night
location1
2
nightlife
$T$ which is a bit of a dump, doesn't reflect LOCATION2 at all
location1
2
nightlife
$T$,  is not exactly the most "up-market " part of town by any means

2
nightlife
$T$,  tend towards being less cool, more touristy

My favourite place is $T$ , despite living in $T$ now

Yes $T$ is nice ( some of it ) , although the tourist bit is rather expensive

all in all $T$ is a good choice

but all I can say is $T$ isn't that bad really

Another good place to consider is $T$ as there are many shops and a few clubs, and it is situated on the central line so only a few stops from central London and hotspots such as Oxford Street

Another place to consider is $T$ - it's got some lovely areas, it's on the river, there are some great independent shops, there are good restaurants and cafes and a great market

$T$ ( NW1 ) is ok , but beware of certain council blocks which do have a reputation

$T$ is lovely , very cultured and artistic it 's down side ( which is also its best point ) is that it 's not near a tube station and you have to get a bus to the nearest ( $T$ ) but this is also its advantage as it gets you away from the grot that usually surrounds a rube station

Great area is $T$
location1
2
green-nature
However, I would say the very worst area is $T$
location1
2
green-nature
However, $T$ is not very pleasant, lots of council estates, it is pretty far from the centre, and the transport is terrible
location1
2
green-nature
I actually think that $T$ aint too bad of a place, I love shopping there
location1
2
green-nature
I also Lived in $T$ for a while, which is a really nice area, but you had to get a bus to the tube station, which was a pain
location1
2
green-nature
I also lived in $T$ another great area  and this time it was a studio apartment with kitchen and bath
location1
2
green-nature
I also love $T$ ; $T$ may still have some areas where you might find something
location1
2
green-nature
I always travel through $T$ and it does look quite interesting but the fact that Ive seen way too many police cars and tape in the high street has made me think twice about visiting
location1
2
green-nature
I currently live in $T$ and I love it

2
green-nature
I currently live just off $T$ and I like it
location1
2
green-nature
I definitely recommend $T$, it's a lovely place
location1
2
green-nature
I do like $T$,  and from what I remember, it is a culturally diverse area where some people still have some sense of community
location1
2
green-nature
I do n't think there 's any safe place to live in London cause the chaos of drugs , alcohol and illegal aliens with the compliment of the government so they can control the masses with the DNA check and the national ID proposal etc Suton , and $T$ are great
location1

2
green-nature
I like the London borough of $T$ in the south and the LOCATION1 in the north
location2
2
green-nature
I like the suburbs because it has less crime and not as many people ( but still busy enough ) $T$ which is in the outskirts of London is nice
location1
2
green-nature
I live in $T$ and i like the area with always something to do if you want to and also provides real calm places when you want it

location1
2
green-nature
I lived in $T$ for 10 years in the 1990s; it is the most genuinely suburban and very attractive
location1
2
green-nature
I lived in al $T$ and it was filthy and overcrowded
location1
2
green-nature
I love $T$ area which is angel tube station
location1
2
green-nature
I love $T$ fully
location1
2
green-nature
I normally don't go down those areas, $T$ is far better and safer
location1
2
green-nature
I prefer $T$ myself as I was lucky enough to live there for a few years and the buildings are amazing, huge and the locals are lovely people
location1
2
green-nature
I really can't think of anything interesting to do in $T$ - and I live not far from it

green-nature
I think $T$ is better but then I'm prejudiced I am originally from London, I grew up in $T$
location1
2
green-nature
I think out of all the places you mention $T$ would be my choice
location1
2
green-nature
I think the whole of $T$ is best avoided to be honest
location1
2
green-nature
I used to live on Gloucester road which was lovely , not so loud and a really cool , relaxed atmosphere $T$ is wonderful you will like it there only minutes from London and more affordable lots of art in bath

location1
2
green-nature
I would hardly consider $T$ to far out  LOCATION2 is not an unsafe area
location1
2
green-nature
I would recommend $T$ because it is 24 hours alive, nice shops and restaurants and ppl never get bored in $T$
location1
2
green-nature
I would recommend $T$ over $T$
location1
2
green-nature
I would suggest that living at the $T$ end of bethnal would be properly scummy, it's horribly busy, dirty and overcrowded
location1
2
green-nature
I would think ( but do n't know ) that $T$ is fine
location1
2
green-nature
I wouldn't recommend $T$ at all

If you are on a budget, people usually stay in the $T$ area which is very popular , and has pretty good nightlife of its own
location1
2
green-nature
If you can afford it then $T$ ( where $T$ is ) is gorgeous but out of most people 's price ranges
location1
2

Just exercise the same caution as you would do at home $T$ is half gentrified and upmarket and the other half is full of bars and restaurants V safe

green-nature
Just up to road in $T$ is plain dangerous, I myself was mugged with a knife there once, and I would thoroughly discourage you to look for anything there

2
green-nature
$T$ ( NW1 ) is ok , but beware of certain council blocks which do have a reputation
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ (SW4) is  an extremely popular area with young professionals, probably due to the huge selection of pubs, bars, restaurants and late-night venues in the area
location1

location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is a very nice and safe area with hostels , it is about ten miles from the centre but the train can take you in in twenty minutes Well Jessy , it seems interesting to me that you 're willing to leave what you kept insisting is the best place in the world

green-nature
$T$ is lovely , very cultured and artistic it 's down side ( which is also its best point ) is that it 's not near a tube station and you have to get a bus to the nearest ( $T$ ) but this is also its advantage as it gets you away from the grot that usually surrounds a rube station
location1

green-nature
$T$ is marvellous

location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is one of the nicer areas and has good access by the underground into central London , it 's mostly occupied by commuters so it 's even more expensive
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is one of the nicest London Boroughs
location1

$T$ is over rated but nice
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is quite exclusive but on the whole nah

green-nature
$T$ is the most-upmarket area , former chic-cool spot turned , getting edgier ( cooler ) as you move up to Ladbroke Grove
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is the nicest borough in SE London
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ is the place for you

location1
2
green-nature
$T$ itself is nice, not really 'toffy' but people are a bit more reserved
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ itself isn't so bad
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ just south of $T$ is nice too , but probably on the expensive side
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ might be good for you as it has no tube or rail  so the prices are lower
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ nice area, consequently VERY expensive
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ obviously , unless you enjoy commuting Anywhere nice in London is at least 250pw for a 1 bed flat plus bills
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ on the whole isnt that bad, just a few streets away the housing and area in general gets much nicer and there are some good shops on the high street that I personally use regularly
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ probably will be better than $T$
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ seems to be the next thing that everyone is talking about
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ used to be really problematic , but is now better , and has decent tube / train links to most of South London
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ village is lovely
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ was one of the worst areas I experienced  My only thought on it is poor doesn't necessarily equate to rough

green-nature
$T$ which is nearby is also very nice some property expense
location1
2
green-nature
$T$ would be ideal
location1
2
green-nature

most kids who live there are bad news  $T$ is a rough area and you would not want to bring your daughter up there

2
green-nature
$T$ (SW4) is  an extremely popular area with young professionals, probably due to the huge selection of pubs, bars, restaurants and late-night venues in the area

Unless you want to go to private nightclubs in the evening and have lots of cash to spend, don't suggest $T$

Yes $T$ is nice ( some of it ) , although the tourist bit is rather expensive

touristy
all in all $T$ is a good choice
location1

touristy
but all I can say is $T$ isn't that bad really
location1

have a look round the 'poets corner' part of $T$ (few nice bars, getting quite trendy), you would get a bit more for your money

Aesthetically I would go for $T$ - it has loads of lovely green space to walk on

Afraid to go out  $T$ is a horrible place full of scum
location1
2

Again these areas have nice parts/bad parts but again they are more cheap ( $T$ can be a bit expensive depending though ) and they can be a bit run down if you go to certain places
location1

Also , $T$ and LOCATION1 are good places for cheap housing , but I find them depressingly suburban

Also, in the back streets behind $T$ (such as Goodge Street and Mortimer Street) you can get a number of nice places with a more traditional feel, and these are usually a bit cheaper as well
location1
2
touristy
Also, you could go to $T$ ("trendy" area of East End, full of pubs, clubs and other interesting things
location1

Alternatively, there is the very popular area of $T$ (and also LOCATION2) although these are probably more expensive

And $T$ is no better, you'll be paying higher rent rates, and have just as many housing estates on your door step
location1
2
touristy
Another good place to consider is $T$ as there are many shops and a few clubs, and it is situated on the central line so only a few stops from central London and hotspots such as Oxford Street
location1
2
touristy
Another place to consider is $T$ - it's got some lovely areas, it's on the river, there are some great independent shops, there are good restaurants and cafes and a great market
location1
2
touristy
Anyway I know where $T$ is and so on but I've never liked it

Anywhere around $T$,  LOCATION2 I'd stay clear off especially after dark

From journeys through $T$ over the years (but without knowing it in great detail admittedly), I can advise you that at least half of the area is attractive, respectable, green and vibrant, which is what you are aiming for

$T$ is lovely , very cultured and artistic it 's down side ( which is also its best point ) is that it 's not near a tube station and you have to get a bus to the nearest ( $T$ ) but this is also its advantage as it gets you away from the grot that usually surrounds a rube station

anywhere apart from $T$ lol
location1
2
touristy
but i would say now-days that $T$ is not too bad  I wouldn't move there because local prices will rocket when they finally get round to finishing the Olympic village

Yes $T$ is nice ( some of it ) , although the tourist bit is rather expensive

2

have a look round the 'poets corner' part of $T$ (few nice bars, getting quite trendy), you would get a bit more for your money

lots of nightlife in The $T$ area, it really buzzes in the evenings   rental accommodation is quite pricey around that area    but I personally would find it a bit claustrophobic to live in

try $T$ in NW London onj the Jubilee Line, there are some 'cheaper' type rooms to rent there

Again these areas have nice parts/bad parts but again they are more cheap ( $T$ can be a bit expensive depending though ) and they can be a bit run down if you go to certain places

Areas in Essex such as $T$ are quite affluent but would be considered by many to be more of a 'new money' crowd

As for $T$ -  you would find it hard to buy anything there for less than 250-300k

You might just find a bedsit or a "studio" as they are now called in a grotty part of London like LOCATION2 or $T$ for 600 pounds but that will be the bare minimum including bills, and the street you are on and the people in your block of flats will probably be quite skanky or even dangerous
