as $T$ does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

there 's another $T$ who i ca n't describe , she is about '' with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're talking about
